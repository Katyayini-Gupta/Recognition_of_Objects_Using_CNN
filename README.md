## Recognition_of_Objects_Using_CNN
Recognition of Objects Using CNN - Inmovidu Internship Project


### Objective
The aim of this project is to build  a deep learning model so as to recognize the object by using CIFAR-10 data set ( Canadian Institute For Advanced Research).


### Concepts Involved
• TENSORFLOW </br>
• KERAS </br>
• MATPLOTLIB </br>
• SUPERVISED LEARNING </br>
• COMPUTER VISION </br>
• DEEP LEARNING </br>
• CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK</br>


### Details of Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. Each image is an RGB image of size 32x32. </br>
